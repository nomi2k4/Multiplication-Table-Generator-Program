Multiplication Table Generator Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program generates a multiplication table for a given number.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input a number
- Uses a for loop to generate the multiplication table
- Prints the multiplication table with numbers from 0 to 10

Features:

- User input for number
- Looping structure using for loop
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./multiplication_table
    - On Windows: multiplication_table.exe
4. Enter a number when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using looping structures (for loop)
- Working with integer variables and multiplication operator
